## pwcheck.py 
is a program that checks whether your password is strong or not. It uses multiple regular expressions to check your password so that it matches the criterion of a strong password 

1.8 characters in length, including symbols, spaces and alphanumeric characters
2.Atleast an uppercase and lowercase letter
3.Atleast one number

pwcheck.py uses the module tryagain.py to allow the user to continue running the program and checking the strength of their password

## tryagain.py
is a program that loops to ask if the user wants to re-run a program or not. Since this is such a common requirement for all programs, I have made it into a separate module that can be reused in my other programs
